    "# Genetic Trading Algorithm (GTA)\n",
    "\n",
    "The principle of the GTA is to exploit the genetic operators of breeding, mutating and selecting, to devise an algorithm to select a portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strategy of an individual\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a market with $m$ stocks, we will devise a strategy that we will represent by an individual of the population.\n",
    "The sequence characterizing an individual will consist of 3 parts :\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1 - The Strategy binaries\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the Genetic Algorithm for Rock, Paper, Scissors, we will suppose that the $2^m$ first binaries will be used as a strategy for a given market :\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance suppose $m=3$, and we have GOOG, SPY and YHOO as stocks in our market. <br>\n",
    "We will denote an increase in the stock relative price by a $1$, and a decrease by a $0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can thus represent every possible market allocation of $m$ stocks with $2^m$ :<br>\n",
    "Here with $m=3$, $000$ means that GOOG, SPY and YHOO went down, $001$ means GOOG and SPY went down, YHOO up, etc ...\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\forall i \\in [[0,2^m-1]]$, we will store in the $i$-th position, the action the individual in the $i$-th market situation. <br>\n",
    "We code this action as a $m$ dimensional array of binaries that we denote $A$, and for $\\forall j \\in [[1,m]]$, if $A(j)=1$ then we buy stock j, if $A(j) = 0$ then we sell stock j.\n",
    "\n",
    "To sum up, one of the table of an individual may look like this for the previous case with $m=3$ :<br>\n",
    "In the $000$-th index of the individual table, we have $101$ which translates in \"If GOOG, SPY and YHOO went down, then buy GOOG, sell SPY, and buy YHOO\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2 - The aggresivity factor\n",
    "\n",
    "We will code in 3 binaries the aggresivity factor, i.e. how much will the individual change his portfolio.\n",
    "For instance suppose, that for a given market allocation, he decides to buy GOOG and sell YHOO, how much will he buy or sell ? \n",
    "\n",
    "Well one way to do this is to define this as an increase or decrease of the quantity of the given stock by a certain percentage. We denote by $\\zeta$ the decimal value of the number coded in the 3 binaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "We give two possible ways :\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>Randomness : we pick a random number $x$ between $0$ and $\\zeta$ and we will increase/decrease the number of stock by $x$.</li>\n",
    "<li>Brute : we simply increase/decrease the % of stock by $\\zeta$</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "__Remark__ : I chose 3 binaries so that we do not exceed change of 7%, as it is first costly to do such changes of position, and it will require a higher computational time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The defensive factor\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the market volatility, it may be safer to hold your position in certain cases. <br>\n",
    "We translate it by a defensive factor that we will code in a few binaries to reflect our incertainty about the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "We give ourselves a safety threshold common to all individuals $\\alpha$. We also denote by $\\xi$ the decimal value of the number coded in those binaries (_number of binaries yet to decide_).We can approach this problem in two ways :\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li> Safety in action : we define a _caprice tendency_ :\n",
    "$$\\mathbb{P}(caprice_i) = \\alpha * \\xi * mistakes$$\n",
    "with $\\mathbb{P}(caprice_i)$ the probability for a given stock $i$ that when the individual has to increase or decrease his position of a given stock, he decides to do nothing. $mistakes$ for a givne stock is the consecutive number of time the individual failed to predict whether it would increase or decrease.</li>\n",
    "<li> Variance safety : if historically the STD of the given stock surpasses a threshold, we choose not to deal with this stock : \n",
    "$$ STD(stock_i) > \\alpha * \\xi \\Longrightarrow \\text{We do nothing}$$\n",
    "</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "__Remark__ : I think we should code $\\xi$ on 3 or binaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "With all this we can define an individual, with all its genes coded in binaries so the genetic operations will be easy to apply.\n",
    "\n",
    "##Â Translation to a portfolio\n",
    "\n",
    "The first day we will suppose we will play the uniform portfolio $b = (1/m,...,1/m)$, and after the first day we will inject the strategy of the fittest individual : based on the market vector, we will receive a $m$ dim array with binaries which will enable us to transfer money based on this suggestion :\n",
    "\n",
    "We increase each stock by a given percentage, and if ever it is not on the convex set we project it (__to review I think__).\n",
    "\n",
    "For a given day $t$, we denote by $\\tilde{b(t)}$ the portfolio suggested by the algorithm, and $b(t)$ the final portfolio we will use for this day.\n",
    "I propose that at time $t+1$, we always compute the portfolio $\\tilde{b(t+1)}$ and depending on the performances of $b(t)$ we define $b(t+1)$ as a combinaison of those two :\n",
    "\n",
    "$$b(t+1) = \\gamma b(t) + (1 - \\gamma) \\tilde{b(t+1)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with \\gamma a dynamic parameter based on the performances of $b(t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Probable downsides\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several issues that can be already seen from this model :\n",
    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>__Computational cost__ : exponential size of the sequence of each individual, which makes the calculation heavy. Not a problem if we trade daily, but for in day trading it may be not be good enough compared to other algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Remark__ : One way to solve this problem may be to reduce $m$, and choose a subset $n \\leq m$ of stocks to trade, based on different criteria :\n",
    "    <ol>\n",
    "    <li>Their Sharpe ratio : whether those stacks have a good return / variance</li>\n",
    "    <li>How correlated those actions are : we may want to pick the most uncorrelated or correlated stocks depending on our vision of the market.</li>\n",
    "    </ol>\n",
    "<li>__Trading commission__ : trading commission have to be taken into account, and we may want to limit the number of trades. We also trade with closing prices, if we want to devise in-day trading strategies we may have to pay to have access to in-day trading prices</li>\n",
